# Contributing guidelines

Make sure to read this otherwise your pull request might be closed due to not respecting contributing guidelines.

## Pull request guidelines

* Don't use master branch for pr's, make separate branch for it with detailed name of your work (e.g `message-support` `event-update`)
* Make your pull request's info somewhat detailed so we know what it does:

```
"This pr adds support for messages event, fixes #1."
```

## Code guidelines

* Use 4 spaces instead of tabs
* Only use let or const, don't use var
* Separate blocks of code with empty lines:

```
code;
more code related code;

code that does something else;
more of that;
```
* Use ;'s
* Use " instead of '
* Name commits nicely:

```
"Updated command x"
"Added support for x"
```
